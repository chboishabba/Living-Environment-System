LES = **Living Environment Simulator**
It’s our umbrella system for modelling **dynamic environmental progression** over time, including:

* **Weather patterns & climate data** (temperature, rainfall, wind, solar radiation).
* **Soil, hydrology & erosion** models.
* **Plant growth & succession** (forests, crops, aquaponics plants).
* **Animal population dynamics** (wildlife, livestock, aquaculture species).
* **Nutrient flows** between water, soil, plants, and animals.
* **Impact modelling** of interventions (e.g., planting windbreaks, changing feed, altering stocking density).

In our architecture:

* **Aquaponics-Calculator** is a *module* inside LES that focuses on **controlled water-based systems** (fish tanks, grow beds).
* LES is the *world engine* that can model both **inside-farm** (aquaponics, greenhouse) and **outside-farm** (pasture, forest, watershed) conditions.

This means:

* Diet & feed optimisation → changes ingredient sourcing → LES can simulate **knock-on environmental effects** (e.g., growing more duckweed reduces nutrient discharge into pond → improves oxygen saturation → changes fish growth curve).
* LES outputs → inform diet/feed optimiser constraints (e.g., predicted lower tomato yield → adjust meal plans, recommend alternative crops).



# 🌍 Living Environment Simulator (LES)

**Part of the Living Environment Platform**
*A modular, multi‑scale, feedback‑aware simulation framework that couples atmosphere, hydrology, geomorphology, vegetation, wildlife, and human systems — designed for research, planning, and interactive visualization.*

---

## 🔎 Overview

**LES** aims to close the gap between siloed scientific models (weather, erosion, ecology) and interactive engines (games/visualization). It provides a **coupling layer**, **common data model**, and **plug‑in API** so specialist process models can exchange state **bidirectionally** on consistent spatial/temporal grids — fast enough for exploratory scenarios, accurate enough for scientific workflows.

**Primary use‑cases**

* Forest/landscape evolution under storms, droughts, wildfire, and management.
* Catchment hydrology: rainfall–runoff–sediment–nutrients with vegetation feedbacks.
* Habitat & wildlife dynamics tied to terrain change and climate variability.
* Decision support: restoration plans, floodplain design, erosion risk, fire mitigation.
* Educational/interactive “living world” demonstrators.

---

## 🎯 Goals & Non‑Goals

**Goals**

* **Modular**: each physical/biological process is a replaceable module.
* **Multi‑scale**: hours→centuries; meters→basins; support grid nesting.
* **Bidirectional coupling**: vegetation ↔ erosion ↔ microclimate ↔ hydrology ↔ wildlife.
* **Reproducible**: CF/UDUNITS‑compliant metadata, deterministic runs, versioned inputs.
* **Performant**: Python orchestrator path (prototyping) and HPC path (MPI/ESMF) from day one.
* **Open**: permissive license, documented APIs, test datasets, example scenarios.

**Non‑Goals**

* A monolithic “one model to rule them all.” LES is a **framework** + curated modules.
* Perfect global climate fidelity; LES focuses on **meso/local** scales and coupling. But who knows!!

### Orchestrator

* **Time manager**: discrete timesteps with sub‑stepping; adaptive where supported.
* **Couplers**: sequential or concurrent exchange with **conservative remapping** (area/flow preserving). Options: LES native coupler (xarray+Dask) or HPC coupler (ESMF/ESMPy, OpenMI, BMI adapters).
* **State registry**: shared **xarray** datasets with CF‑conventions; variable naming schema (e.g., `veg.canopy_cover`, `hyd.q_surface`, `atm.precip_rate`).
* **Event bus**: ZeroMQ/gRPC for module messages (e.g., fire ignition, management actions).

### Module API (LES‑BMI)

Minimal interface (inspired by **CSDMS BMI**):

* `initialize(config)` → returns capability flags (grid type, dt range, variables read/write).
* `update(dt)` → advances internal state; exposes `get_value(var)` / `set_value(var)`.
* `finalize()`
* Grid/mesh getters; CRS; metadata; checkpoint/restore hooks.

---

## 📦 Process Modules (first‑class citizens)

**Atmosphere**

* *Options*: Stochastic weather generator; WRF downscaled inputs; ERA5 reanalysis ingestion.
* *Exchanges*: precip, short/longwave radiation, wind, air T/RH, P.

**Hydrology**

* *Surface*: kinematic/kinematic‑wave or shallow‑water (Saint‑Venant) approximations.
* *Subsurface*: bucket/Richards‑lite soil moisture; TOPMODEL‑style runoff indices.
* *Exchanges*: infiltration, runoff, baseflow, soil moisture, ET components.

**Geomorphology / Erosion**

* Hillslope diffusion + stream power law; Exner sediment continuity.
* Channel hydraulics (bank shear stress, critical Shields number), sediment transport rating curves.
* *Exchanges*: updated DEM, sediment fluxes, bank stability → feeds habitat & vegetation.

**Vegetation / Ecosystem**

* Two tracks:

  1. **Procedural‑growth forest** (multi‑scale canopy competition à la “Natural Forest Growth” simulators) for interactive runs.
  2. **Biophysical DGVM‑lite** (LPJ‑style NPP, LAI, phenology, mortality) for climate sensitivity.
* *Exchanges*: canopy cover, root depth, roughness, litter, transpiration, shade, soil binding.

**Wildlife / Agents**

* Agent‑based movement (correlated random walk / step‑selection) with habitat suitability maps; energetic budgets and predation/grazing.
* *Exchanges*: grazing pressure, seed dispersal, disturbance, carcass nutrients.

**Fire (optional)**

* Empirical spread model (ROS from wind, slope, fuel moisture); crown vs surface fire; post‑fire mortality.
* *Exchanges*: canopy loss, soil hydrophobicity, smoke forcing.

**Human Systems (optional)**

* Land‑use transitions, management actions (thinning, planting, levees), water withdrawals/returns.

---

## 🧮 Numerics & Algorithms (baseline choices)

**Time stepping & coupling**

* **Operator splitting** with **sequential coupling** by default (A→B→C in a super‑step), with configurable **exchange frequency** per variable.
* Optional **concurrent/MPI** mode for HPC modules.

**Spatial discretization**

* Regular lat/lon or projected **rectilinear grids**; optional unstructured meshes via ESMF.
* **Nested grids** for hotspots (e.g., high‑res floodplain in coarse basin).

**Key formulations**

* Rainfall–runoff: Green–Ampt infiltration; Unit Hydrograph or Muskingum routing.
* ET: Penman–Monteith; canopy resistance from LAI & VPD.
* Hillslope: linear diffusion; channels: stream‑power incision ($E = K Q^m S^n$).
* Sediment: Exner: $\partial(\eta)/\partial t + (1/(1-\lambda_p))\nabla\cdot q_s = 0$.
* Vegetation light competition: Beer–Lambert; photosynthesis–respiration balance for NPP.
* Wildlife movement: step‑selection with resource selection functions (RSF); density‑dependent mortality.

**Units/metadata**

* **UDUNITS**; **CF‑1.x** variable names/attributes; **ISO‑8601** time. CRS via **PROJ/CRS‑WKT**.

---

## 🗂 GIS & Plans Intake

* **Raster**: Cloud‑Optimized GeoTIFF/GeoTIFF, NetCDF/GRIB and chunked Zarr stores ingested with **rioxarray/xarray**.
* **Vector**: **GeoPackage** and **FlatGeobuf** layers via **GeoPandas** (legacy Shapefile tolerated).
* **Catalogs**: **STAC** entries with optional caching to local Zarr/Parquet for reproducibility.
* **Plans**: **IFC/DWG/DXF** site plans converted (ifcopenshell/FME/QGIS) to GeoPackage layers; optional 3D path IFC → CityJSON/CityGML → Cesium 3D Tiles for visualization. Information loss outside native BIM is documented.
* **CRS policy**: all inputs reprojected to the scenario CRS and tagged with metadata; outputs remain **CF/UDUNITS** compliant.
* **Processing queue**: headless **QGIS Processing**/**GDAL** steps recompute derived rasters (slope, buffers, least‑cost paths) on demand.

---

## 🧭 Planning & Decision Support

* **Scenario manager**: YAML definitions of interventions and levers (planting density, setbacks, detention basins, stocking rates).
* **Multi‑criteria evaluation / geodesign**: weighted raster overlays and constraint maps built with **xarray+Dask** map algebra.
* **Optimisation**: multi‑objective solvers (e.g., **NSGA‑II**, **CP‑SAT**) explore trade‑offs among cost, erosion, habitat, yield.
* **Probabilistic reasoning**: **Bayesian networks** and risk models consume GIS layers and simulation outputs.
* **Agent‑based models**: movement and behaviour driven by GIS suitability rasters and network layers for wildlife or human agents.

Results feed closed‑loop controllers, diet/feed planners, and stakeholder dashboards.

---

## ⚙️ Execution & Visualization

* **Prototype mode**: Python orchestrator with **xarray+Dask** and headless **QGIS Processing** for geoprocessing.
* **HPC mode**: **ESMF/ESMPy** or **OpenMI** coupling on MPI for parallel modules with conservative remapping.
* **Visualization**: ParaView/QGIS for analysis; **Cesium 3D Tiles** or WebGL maps for interactive digital‑twin views.
* **Scenario UI**: sliders and dashboards driving YAML configurations for exploratory planning sessions.

---

## ✅ Current State of Play (SOTP) & SOTA Snapshot

**SOTP (what practitioners do today)**

* Run **specialist models** separately (WRF for weather; SWAT/MIKE SHE for hydrology; CAESAR‑Lisflood/LSDTopoTools for erosion; LPJ‑GUESS/SORTIE‑ND for vegetation; GAMA/HexSim for wildlife), then **hand‑off** static layers between them with coarse temporal sync.
* Limited **two‑way feedback**; high effort for data wrangling; results hard to visualize interactively.

**SOTA exemplars (by domain)**

* **Coupling frameworks**: **ESMF/ESMPy**, **OpenMI**, **CSDMS BMI**; coastal stacks like **MOSSCO**.
* **Atmosphere**: **WRF**, **OpenIFS+SURFEX** (downscaling, data assimilation).
* **Hydrology**: **MIKE SHE**, **Delft3D**, **SWAT+** (catchment to coastal coupling).
* **Geomorphology**: **Landlab** (composable Python components), **CAESAR‑Lisflood** (long‑term morphodynamics).
* **Vegetation**: **LPJ‑GUESS** (DGVM), **SORTIE‑ND** (forest gap dynamics), high‑performance **procedural forest growth** models for interactive scaling.
* **Wildlife**: **HexSim**, **GAMA** (spatial ABMs with GIS).

**Where LES advances**

* **Real‑time, multi‑domain coupling** with **bidirectional** exchanges at controllable frequencies.
* A **unified state registry** (xarray) with CF metadata to minimize glue code.
* **Two execution paths**: rapid Python+Dask prototyping **and** HPC MPI coupling for heavy runs.
* **Bridges to interactive engines**, enabling explainable scenario exploration.

---

## 🧪 Validation, Calibration, QA

* **Golden scenarios**: canonical test basins and forest plots with published benchmarks.
* **Regression tests**: numerical tolerances on time series and maps (pytest + xarray tests).
* **Calibration**: GLUE/Bayesian (e.g., `emcee`) parameter inference; Sobol sensitivity.
* **Uncertainty**: ensemble runs; propagate input/weather uncertainty to outputs.

If we want this to stand out and actually work as **the** farm-to-plate-and-pond planner, the “must-haves” break down into five core feature clusters — anything less and we’re just reinventing one of the partial tools you listed.

---

## **1. Unified Ingredient & Nutrient Database**

**Why:** Everything downstream depends on accurate nutrient vectors and availability.

* ✅ **Single source of truth** for both human foods and feed ingredients.
* ✅ Support for **nutrient profiles** (macro, micro, amino acids, fatty acids, bioavailability modifiers).
* ✅ Source tags (`on_farm`, `supplier`, `wild_harvest`).
* ✅ **Seasonal yield forecasts** (from LES & Aquaponics-Calculator).
* ✅ Processing loss factors (cooking, drying, fermentation).

---

## **2. Dual Optimizers (Human Diet + Feed)**

**Why:** This is our differentiator — coupling human nutrition and animal/fish nutrition into one optimisation loop.

* **Human menu optimizer**

  * Meets RDI/NRV for chosen personas.
  * Enforces preferences (veg, allergies, cultural).
  * Maximises use of on-farm harvest.
  * Minimises cost / off-farm purchases.
  * Variety and meal-structure constraints.

* **Animal/fish feed optimizer**

  * Meets species-specific nutrient needs (digestible basis).
  * Applies inclusion caps (e.g., max % duckweed, azolla).
  * Minimises cost and waste.
  * Matches pellet/binder requirements.

* Both optimizers **share the same ingredient pool** and respect total inventory limits.

---

## **3. Inventory & Production Integration**

**Why:** You can’t optimise if you don’t know what’s coming in.

* Automatic import of **real-time inventory** from farm systems.
* Integration with **forecast modules** (plant growth, harvest dates, biomass models for fish).
* Yield uncertainty modelling (so the optimizer can plan for ± scenarios).
* Ability to log and adjust **unexpected events** (disease, crop failure).

---

## **4. Supplement & Procurement Planner**

**Why:** Tells you exactly what to buy to meet nutrition gaps.

* Generates **shopping list** of supplements/off-farm ingredients.
* Calculates **cheapest local source** or **preferred supplier**.
* Suggests **on-farm production adjustments** to reduce reliance on purchased items long-term.

---

## **5. Feedback & Scenario Loop**

**Why:** Links to LES for “what if” planning.

* Export diet/feed plans to **LES** for environmental impact modelling (water use, nutrient cycling, oxygen demand).
* Re-run optimisation under different scenarios:

  * Reduced sunlight (weather event)
  * Loss of specific crop
  * Higher/lower fish stocking density
  * Price spikes in purchased ingredients
* Reports KPIs: % self-sufficiency, cost, nutrient adequacy, sustainability score.

---

## **Nice-to-Haves (but not day-one critical)**

* 📈 **GHG and energy footprint** calculations.
* 🤖 ML-assisted menu/feed suggestions based on past choices and feedback.
* 🧪 HACCP-style safety logging for critical control points.
* 📱 Mobile app interface for quick adjustments on the go.
* 🌦 Weather integration for seasonal planting and yield forecasting.
* 🐟 Oxygen budget calculation tied to Home Assistant automation.

---


There are a few categories of tools that touch parts of what we’re describing, but we're trying to cover the **whole “design human diets + animal/fish feed from on-farm production with supplement top-ups”** loop out of the box.

Here’s the landscape:

---

## **1. Human diet formulation tools**

These do menu planning, but usually ignore feed loops and farm production constraints.

| Tool                                | Strengths                                                                         | Gaps for Our Use                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

---

## **2. Livestock/fish feed formulation**

These focus on least-cost ration formulation but don’t consider human diets or shared resource planning.

| Tool                                                                  | Strengths                                             | Gaps for Our Use                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WinFeed**                                                           | Windows app, least-cost formulation, can handle fish. | Closed-source, manual ingredient input, no integration with crops/harvest. |
| **BestMix / Format International**                                    | Industry-grade formulation software.                  | Expensive, locked-in, no farm-scale coupling.                              |
| **AquaFeed Formulation Software (various)**                           | Targeted to aquaculture species.                      | Proprietary, no human diet features, no on-farm resource matching.         |
| **Open Forage Ration Balancers** (DairyNZ, Feedipedia + spreadsheets) | Open data, known formulas.                            | Manual, species-limited, no central orchestrator.                          |

---

## **3. Farm resource planners**

These manage inventory/yields but not nutrient optimization.

| Tool                         | Strengths                                        | Gaps for Our Use                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |

## **4. Research / academic prototypes**

Some projects come close conceptually:

* **FAO’s Diet Problem Linear Programming Spreadsheets** — Excel LP models for least-cost human diets with local foods.
* **Nutrient Optimiser** — open-source nutrient density tool, some LP diet functions.
* **Feedipedia + linear programming** — used in animal nutrition teaching.
* **SustainFarm project tools** — model integration of crop-livestock production for sustainability, but not interactive.

---

## **What’s Missing (Our Niche)**

We want one platform that:

* Pulls **real-time and forecast inventory** from farm production (LES/Aquaponics-Calculator).
* Uses **nutrient composition tables** for both human food and feed ingredients.
* Runs **multi-objective optimization** for:

  * Human diet plans that hit RDI and preferences.
  * Animal/fish feed formulas that hit species requirements.
* Minimizes **off-farm supplement purchases**.
* Feeds outputs into **LES scenarios** and **real-world automation**.

None of the tools above do all of this — the closest is to combine:

* Open nutrient DBs (AUSNUT, USDA FDC, Feedipedia).
* Open LP solvers (PuLP, OR-Tools, SciPy).
* Our existing **Aquaponics-Calculator** + LES data model.

---
Because we are cohabitating with our domesticated animals, we work on the presumption of ourselves as the active catalyst within the einvornment, and thus treat it as two tightly-coupled planners as a beginning point:

1. human **food design** (menus/recipes) using what you grow, topped up with supplements;
2. **feed design** for your fish (and plants via nutrient dosing), using on-farm inputs + targeted amino/mineral adds.

I’ll lay out goals, data you need, the optimization models, and how it plugs into your Aquaponics-Calculator + LES stack.

# What we’re building

* A **least-cost, nutrient-complete** *menu builder* for humans and *feed formulator* for fish, both driven by **what’s actually available on the farm** (seasonal harvests, yields) with the option to **buy only the gaps**.
* It runs weekly: ingests inventory & expected harvests → proposes menus/feeds that meet targets (nutrient RDIs / species requirements) → outputs **shopping/supplement list** + **production tasks**.

# Core datasets (add these tables)

* `ingredients` (humans) / `feed_ingredients` (fish): name, unit, cost/kg, **nutrient vector** (see below), allergens, processing losses (%), stock\_on\_hand, lead\_time, source={farm, supplier}.
* `nutrients`: id, name, unit, upper/lower bounds per **persona** (humans) or **species+life\_stage** (fish).
* `recipes` (humans): many-to-many `recipe_items` with grams per serving; processing: yield factor, cook loss (protein, vit C, etc.).
* `menus`: 7-day plan mapping people → recipes.
* `feed_formulas`: inclusion rates (% DM) → pellet size → daily ration by biomass.
* `harvest_forecasts`: item, expected\_kg, availability\_window.
* `supplements`: amino acids (lysine, methionine, threonine), vitamins/minerals, salt mix, oils.
* `constraints`: user prefs (vegan, allergies), cultural constraints, max inclusion rates (e.g., **duckweed ≤ 30% DM**, **BSFL ≤ 20% DM**, **azolla ≤ 15% DM** unless proven).

## Nutrient vectors

* **Humans**: energy, protein, **DIAAS** adj. protein, fat, n-6, n-3 (ALA/EPA/DHA), carbs, fibre, Ca, Fe (heme/non-heme), Zn, Mg, K, Na, I, Se, Cu, Mn, B12, folate, choline, vit A (RAE), D, E, K, C, B1/2/3/5/6/7. Include **bioavailability modifiers** (e.g., phytate → Fe/Zn).
* **Fish (tilapia/trout as examples)**: energy (MJ/kg), digestible protein, essential AAs (Lys, Met+Cys, Thr, Trp, Arg, Ile, Leu, Val, His, Phe+Tyr), lipid (n-3 HUFA targets for species), starch limit, fibre limit, Ca, P (digestible), NaCl, vitamin premix, ash max.

# Optimization models

## A) Human menus (weekly)

**Decision vars**

* $x_{i,d,m}$ grams of ingredient *i* used on day *d*, meal *m* (or recipe servings $y_{r,d,m}$).

**Objective**

* Minimize **purchased cost** $\sum c_i \cdot \max(0, \text{use}_i - \text{farm}_i)$
  or multi-objective: *cost – λ·farm\_utilization + μ·GHG\_intensity reduction*.

**Constraints**

* Nutrient coverage per person/day:
  $L_k \le \sum_i n_{ik} \cdot x_{i,d,\*} \le U_k$ for all nutrients *k*.
* Inventory & harvest windows:
  $\sum_{d} x_{i,d,\*} \le \text{stock}_i + \text{harvest}_i$.
* Meal structure (e.g., 3 meals/day), max prep time per day, kitchen capacity (optional).
* Dietary prefs: allergens $x_{i,\*,\*}=0$, vegetarian etc.
* Processing losses: apply yield matrices to cooked recipes.
* Variety/acceptability (soft): minimum distinct recipes per week, cap repeats.

**Solvers**

* Start with **OR-Tools CP-SAT** or linear programming (PuLP/OR-Tools LP); add integer vars for recipe servings.

## B) Fish feed formulation (batch)

**Decision vars**

* $z_j$ inclusion fraction of feed ingredient *j* (DM basis).

**Objective**

* Least cost: minimize $\sum_j c_j z_j$.

**Constraints**

* Target nutrient ranges (digestible basis):
  $L_a \le \sum_j AA_{ja} z_j \le U_a$ (for all essential amino acids),
  lipid range, fibre max, starch max, **Ca\:P digestible ratio**, ash max.
* Functional caps: e.g., **BSFL oil ≤ x%**, **duckweed ≤ y%**, **azolla ≤ y%**, **microalgae** inclusion for EPA/DHA.
* Pellet physics (optional): sum binders ≥ min, moisture target.
* Regularization (palatability): keep big changes small vs last formula (ℓ1 penalty).

**Solvers**

* Pure LP with bounds; switch to **QP** if you add smoothness penalties.

### C) Coupling with operations

* Daily ration $R = f(BW, T, SGR)$ → from your TGC growth model.
* Check **oxygen budget** vs planned feed; bump aeration if needed (your HA automation).

# On-farm ingredient strategy (what to grow/produce)

* **Protein**: duckweed, azolla, water spinach, microgreens; **BSF larvae** (on farm waste); **red wrigglers**; legumes (if space).
* **Lipids (n-3)**: microalgae (Nannochloropsis), flax/chia (ALA) + small **fish oil** supplement for HUFA (species dependent).
* **Minerals**: eggshell → CaCO₃; Mg via Epsom salt; K via ash/K₂SO₄; Fe chelate for plants.
* **Human staples**: leafy greens, herbs, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers; grains/pulses optionally off-farm.
* **Processing**: fermentations (tempeh/koji) to boost **DIAAS**, reduce antinutrients; sprouting for vit C/folate; solar dehydration for shelf-stable veg powders.

# Bioavailability & safety

* Apply **phytate\:Zn** and **phytate\:Fe** penalty functions to adjust effective intake.
* **HACCP** steps for feed/food: critical control points (water activity, pH after fermentation, storage temps, mycotoxin risk in BSF/feeds), traceability logs.

# How this plugs into your stack

**Aquaponics-Calculator**

* Add endpoints: `/optimize/human-menu`, `/optimize/fish-feed`.
* Ingest: `harvest_forecasts`, `ingredients`, `nutrients`, `supplements`, `prices`.
* Emit: menu PDFs/shopping list; feed formula + pellet batch sheet.
* Tie to **alerts**: if optimizer requires off-farm purchase > threshold, flag “deficit” and suggest which crop/supplement closes the gap.

**LES (Environment Simulator)**

* Scenario linkage: change planting density → changes expected harvest → changes feasible menu/feed space; conversely, nutrition targets can imply required cropland/bed area.
* Water/N balance: feed protein → TAN load → plant uptake requirement; close loops automatically.

# Minimal viable feature set (2 sprints)

**Sprint 1**

* Data model + ingestion (AUSNUT/USDA FoodData Central for humans; feed tables for fish + your on-farm items).
* LP feed formulator (tilapia starter/grower/finisher as a template).
* Menu LP for 1 adult persona; cost + farm-first objective.
* Exporter: shopping list (off-farm) + harvest utilization plan.

**Sprint 2**

* Processing losses & DIAAS adjustment; phytate penalty.
* TGC-driven ration + oxygen budget check → HA aeration target.
* Preference/variety constraints, simple weekly UI.
* “What to plant next” recommender: marginal gain in menu/feed feasibility per crop m².

# Example: tiny LP (fish feed) in math

Minimize $\sum_j c_j z_j$
s.t.

* $\sum_j z_j = 1$
* Protein: $\sum_j DP_j z_j \ge 0.34$ (34% DP grower)
* Lys: $\sum_j Lys_j z_j \ge 0.018$
* Met+Cys: $\sum_j MetCys_j z_j \ge 0.009$
* Lipid: $0.08 \le \sum_j Fat_j z_j \le 0.12$
* Fibre: $\sum_j Fibre_j z_j \le 0.06$
* Digestible P: $\sum_j dP_j z_j \ge 0.006$
* BSFL ≤ 0.20, Duckweed ≤ 0.30, Azolla ≤ 0.15, Binder ≥ 0.03.

# Example: weekly human menu (sketch)

* Personas: Adult M 10.5 MJ, Adult F 8.5 MJ.
* Hard constraints: protein ≥ 1.0 g/kg BW; Ca ≥ 1000 mg; Fe ≥ 8/18 mg (sex-specific); B12 ≥ 2.4 µg; omega-3 ALA ≥ 1.6/1.1 g; sodium ≤ 2 g.
* Farm inputs favored: lettuce, basil, cherry tomato, kale, tilapia, duckweed powder, microgreens, eggs, herbs.
* Optimizer proposes meals; **supplement list** might be: iodized salt, B12 (if mainly plant-based), Vit D in winter, small fish oil for DHA/EPA if desired.

# Safety & compliance

* Keep human nutrition targets aligned with **NHMRC (Australia) NRVs**;
  fish feed targets from species literature; log sources in metadata.
* Label allergens, maintain traceability for every batch.





Here’s a side-by-side framing of **our Aquaponics-Calculator + Environment Simulator** vs. a variety of plant/gardening data APIs.

## **Technical Depth**

|                | **Our Stack**                                                                             | **Listed APIs**                                              |

| **Automation** | Hooks to Home Assistant/MQTT for actuators (aeration, dosing, feeding).                   | None; external systems must decide what to do with the data. |

---

## **Where They Complement Us**

* **Species trait enrichment**:
  We could pull from **Perenual, APIFarmer, Trefle** to populate our `species` table with growth ranges, tolerances, nutrient needs, and phenology.
* **Garden planning intelligence**:
  Verdantly-style recommendations could be an “advisory layer” in our dashboard for selecting compatible crops or plants in aquaponics beds.
* **Climate zone mapping**:
  APIs with USDA/FAO zone data could pre-set defaults in scenarios for the Environment Simulator.

---

## **Where We Surpass Them**

* Live feedback loops (sensor data → analytics → control).
* Multi-species, multi-domain simulation.
* Direct actuation for real-world systems.
* Scenario forecasting (what-if storms, droughts, feed changes).

---

## **Integration Example**

Imagine LES + Aquaponics-Calculator running a simulated or real system:

1. **Species data import** from APIFarmer → populate plant nutrient uptake and tolerance.
2. **Weather forcing** from WRF or ERA5.
3. **Simulation loop**:

   * Forecast evapotranspiration & nutrient loads.
   * Adjust irrigation/nutrient dosing via Home Assistant.
4. **Visualize** growth progression and environmental impact over months/years.
