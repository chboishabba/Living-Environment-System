# Farm-to-Plate-and-Pond Optimizer Roadmap from https://github.com/chboishabba/Aquaponics-Calculator/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md

The roadmap outlines phased development for integrating diet and feed optimisation with live environmental simulation (LES) and nutrient databases.

## Phase Details

### MVP (Phase&nbsp;1)

- Unified ingredient and nutrient database combining AUSNUT, USDA FDC, Feedipedia and aquaculture tables
- Basic dual optimizers for human diet planning and feed formulation sharing a common inventory
- Manual inventory input with expected harvest fields
- Simple supplement list generator outlining off‑farm needs
- Static reports summarising diet and feed plans with self‑sufficiency metrics

### Phase 2 – Live Data & Automation Hooks

- Live inventory and production integration pulling data from Aquaponics‑Calculator and LES forecasts
- Scenario simulation link to push plans into LES and evaluate environmental impacts
- Procurement optimizer comparing suppliers, prices and lead times
- Expanded species support covering multiple personas and animal types
- Home Assistant / MQTT hooks to automate aeration, feeding and dosing

### Phase 3 – Predictive & AI‑Enhanced

- Machine learning enhancements to predict yield shortfalls and fill missing nutrient data
- Multi‑objective optimisation balancing cost, sustainability and nutrient adequacy
- Real‑time adaptive control re‑optimising plans as conditions change
- User preference learning for tailored menu and feed suggestions
- Mobile app with offline mode for remote decision support
